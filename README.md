# ULTIMATE IMAGE COMPRESSOR
_1. Converts image to only binary-coloured (black & white)
2. Halves the size of the image (by default, but u can change it)_
 
### Let's see it work:
#####     BEFORE
![input image](example-folder/example-image.jpg)
**Size: 760 KB**
 
#####     AFTER
![output image](my-brand-new-images/example-image.png)
**Size: 41.7 KB**
 
_Amazing, isn't it?_
